## This is how I can help you

Contribute and evaluate

1. I join your team as an engineer for 1 to 6 months. But my role is more like a secret agent.

2. I contribute to your projects as a regular employee. That allows me to evaluate your software development and project management practices from the insider position.

3. I work with your people arm to arm. That allows me to evaluate their technical and soft skills and see how does a team function as a whole.

Improve and train

4. I give you regular feedback on my findings. Together, we improve things on the go or prepare a plan to handle your issues in the future.

5. I train your people to handle your problems without me. Motivated and empowered team is the key to your success.

6. I leave you with a stronger team, defined processes and software in a better shape.
